Taints and tolerations describe rules for what pods can be scheduled on which nodes.

Taints exist on nodes.

Add toleration to a specific pod to allow certain Taints

Taints - NODES

kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

Taint Effects:
- NoSchedule: no new pods can be scheduled on this node
- PreferNoSchedule: system will try to avoid placing pod on node
- NoExecute: new pods will not scheduled and existing pods will be evicted without toleration

kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule


Toleration - PODS

tolerations:
- key: "app"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "blue"
  effect: "NoSchedule" 

Taints and tolerations does not gaurentee pods will be scheduled on a certain node. It will just enforce that node does not take pods without a certain toleration.

Node Affinity is what gaurentees pods go to a specific node.
